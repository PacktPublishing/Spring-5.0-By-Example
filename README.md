# Spring 5.0 By Example
This is the code repository for [Spring 5.0 By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/spring-50-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788624398), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Spring makes application development extremely simple and also improves developer productivity by reducing initial configuration time and providing tools to increase efficiency.

In the first part of the book, we will learn how to construct a CMS Portal using Spring's support for building REST APIs. We will also integrate these APIs with AngularJS. We will later develop this application in a reactive fashion by using Project Reactor, Spring WebFlux and Spring Data.

In the second part, we will build an amazing messaging application, which will consume the Twitter API and perform some filtering and transformations. We will then play around with Server Sent Events and explore Springâ€™s support for Kotlin which makes application development quick and efficient.

In the last part, we will build a real microservice application by using the most important techniques and patterns such as service discovery, circuit breakers, security, data streams, monitoring, and a lot more from this architectural style.

By the end of the book, you will be comfortable with the concepts of spring boot and spring cloud.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter01 does not contain code files.
All the remaining chapters contains code files pressent in their respective folders. 

The code will look like the following:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The readers are expected to have a basic knowledge of Java. Notion about Distributed
Systems is an added advantage.
To execute code files in this book, you would need to have the following
software/dependencies:
* IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
* Docker CE
